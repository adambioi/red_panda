# Overview
This will run tests to make sure that everything is set up correctly on your environment.

Before the tests can be run, please make sure that you have most recent version of the annotation for either the human or mouse genome.

## Annotation

For Red Panda to run correctly, the annotation of your genome, in gtf format, must be downloaded and used.

Annotation for the human genome (release v. 96) can be found here: ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-96/gtf/homo_sapiens

Annotation for the mouse genome (release v. 96) can be found here: ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-96/gtf/mus_musculus
